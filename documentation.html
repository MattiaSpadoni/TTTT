			<p>Description: the style want to reproduce the late medieval manuscript, ideally the humanistic 1440 manuscript. 
			It starts from dividing in 2 columns the document on a parchment background, in order to imitate a common use in ancient manuscripts. On the other side the fact that we are online blocks us from trying to reproduce also the structure of a book divided in pages.
			At the same time I modeled the layout to be loyal to the page structure typical of a humanistic manuscript through the use of the golden ratio. From our historical sources I understood that the blank space around the text is bigger under and above the text, is medium on the external side of the page and lower on the internal one. Spaces are not created randomly and everyone is proportional to the others through golden ration. I maintained this proportion using a 13% top and bottom padding, a 8% left and right padding and a column gap of 10% (resulting in a gap of 5% for each column). These numbers were not random, in fact I chose them from the Fibonacci sequence.
			In order to avoid a displeasent appearance on small and medium screens I decided to break the 2 column pagination when going under the 768px screen definition. At the same time I maintained the golden ratio proportion among all text margins.
			The font is derived from the formalization of one of humanistic fonts. Paleography studies says that humanistic fonts were deeply bounded to carolingian fonts trying to recover the ancient roman way of writing. Conrad Sweynheym and Arnold Pannartz were the first humanists to introduce
			movable type printing press in Italy, they based their font on the Humanistic minuscole used during their time. According to this fact I chose to use their font as one of the major font during that period.
			One of elements that differentiate humanistic minuscole from carolingian one was the lighter hink on manuscripts. This fact is reproduced by CSS through text opacity.
			The use of subscriptions reproduce the lines left by monks when they used special tools to avoid writing crooked.
			Paragraph lines are a bit more separated one from the other in order to represent the typical humanistic manuscript. In fact besides their inspiration to carolingian way of writing, humanistic writers prefers to use a lighter page with much more white space than past manuscripts. The humanistic way of writing born from Petrarca as a reaction to the heavy and dark page of late gothic manuscripts. Indeed it is why I tried to maintain a light page with a lot of space and a weaker color of text than usual.
			The initial sections' capital lettere is, on the other side, not philological, this fact is linked to the lack of historically correct capital letter fonts. After an unsuccesful research I used the most correct free font I was able to find on the internet.

			<p>Context: Web Technologies exam, master degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge, academic year: 2018-2019.</p>
			<p>Description (fictional description): the development of cloud technologies reached a new level. Through the use of contact lenses we are now connected to the net itself. The display of paragraph is only poorly supported by old devices. In reality all sections and windows are spreaded along our visual area allowing us to look at specific windows.
			After the initial hype there was a fisiological drop in interest in this technology. During the <em>new information conference</em> held Rome in 2031, the use of smart contact lenses started to become much more common among people. 1 year later there was another huge progression, the use of a background theme. This improvement started by the will of some people to feel immersed in a virtual space.
			During that period a lot of people tried to realise a sort of copy of the world, but soon this fashion died.
			People started to feel unconfort with a too loyal representation of the tangible reality.
			The development stopped between 2037 and 2045 due to the III world war between the Neo-URSS and the Great Capitalist America.
			After a tremendous war the Neo-URSS resulted victorius and smart contact lenses restarted to improve.
			During last years of '40s there was a huge revival of old fashioned way to think the net and in 2049 started to become common the usage of a background made like what people in '10s thought that internet was: a net of electrical connections.
			This view didn't affect only the way of thinking the background, but also the font and the animation we used:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The font is a common futuristic/technological of late 10s, now we have a lot of more common fonts like Times New Roman 2.0 and Neo costructivists font, but in 2050 the fashion about old style internet was so strong that these font were rejected.</li>
				<li>The animation tried to reproduce the display of text inside our visual area, even if today (in 2065) is common to go inside a completely loaded information space, there are still some articles using that type of animation.
				We also included a support for old devices used during the '10s. In that case we used 3 different type of animation bounded to different type of elements in the page to mimic a little part of what you can see in a complete 360° elements display.
				From a margin right of 50% to 25% and a margin left of 50% to 5% is the animation used for odd paragraphs, the reversed one for even paragraphs a 50% to 30% on both sides animation is the one used for all text elements that are not paragraphs.
				Everyone use a 2 seconds delay before starting.</li>

      		<p>We created 2 different scripts for 2 different reasons.
      		The first script is the one that change the content and the style of the iframe. a little Javascript is used firstly to change the SRC of the iframe and then through the <em>onload</em> wait until the page is loaded and then changing the CSS of the page. During the charge the iframe is hidden making impossible for users to see the changes going on.</p>

      		<p>The second script is used to automatically populate the page of the EU-directive. In fact at the beginning the page is empty and only through 2 fetch (a mechanism to handle in a simpler way calls to the server) the page is populated with all tags coming from 2 different HTML documents. We realized this script in order to have something that automatically take elements of different language versions of the same document and puts them in a grid without a long manual encoding. </p>
