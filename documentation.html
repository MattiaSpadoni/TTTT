      <h2>Author: Mattia Spadoni</h2>
			<h2>Context</h2> 
      <p>Web Technologies exam, DHDK master degree, Bologna University, academic year: 2018-2019</p>
			<h2>Description</h2> 
      <h3>Time Period</h3>
      <p>1445</p>
      <h3>Concept</h3>
      <p>The 1445 typographical style aims to reproduce the late italian medieval (or humanistic) manuscript.</p>
			<h3>Layout</h3>
      <p>The style starts from the use of a parchment background. The body of the HTML is set to a dark gray color, after it every article has a background image made by a parchment. It is a .png file, 721x864 px, it is repeated along the y axis to cover the all document without being streched. I cropped the image along its borders to make more realistic the shape of a parchment <em>folio</em> (sheet).
      Following a common humanistic practice I decided to use the golden ratio canon rule to designate the text area. Through the use of CSS percentage property I set the article padding to be coherent with the Golden ratio Rule. Bottom padding is 55%, the top is 34%, the left one to 21% and the right one is 13%. Through media queries I adapted the proportion to a more adequate one starting from a width minor than 768 px. I follow the Fibonacci sequence to maintain the golden ratio.

      
      <p>Clarification: the proportion is studied to show the ideally left page of a manuscript.
      In the Eu directive document the proportion is maintained at the article level.</p>

      <h3>Font</h3>
      <p>The font is the Sweynheim-Pannartz font. Conrad Sweynheym and Arnold Pannartz introduced movable type printing process in Italy from the Benedictin monastery of Subiaco. They did it in 1476 and they modeled their font on the one used in manuscript of that time.
      I didn't choose a gothic font due to the fact that humanistists (starting from Petrarca) created a new way of writing as an answer to the dark, bold and difficult to read late gothic fonts used in Europe. They took inspiration from the Carolingian way of writing believing that was the font used from original classic Roman authors. Even if they were wrong their font became the standard.
      The ink is not completely black, but a shade of dark gray, I combined this choice with a CSS increase of font weight. I used these 2 elements to create a page with nearly bold letters but with a not so dark writing. I made this choice starting from the observation of several images of manuscripts combining that with the natural degradation of color through time.
      The line and letter separation is a little higher than the usual standard today, I made this choice starting from the observation of  humanistic manuscripts. Humanists reacted to the gothic dark and heavy page, I tried to create a light page with a good black and white balance.</p>
      <p>Since I was not able to find a totally historical correct I chose the most similar to the one used during late medieval age with white letters and grapevine decoration.</p>
      <p>I modeled the font size according to suggestions given by an online article about the font dimension, the source is at the end of the section. Little changes are applied to scale proportionally all dimensions.</p>


      <h3>Text decoration</h3>

      <p>All barely visible subscriptions are the reproduction of a tipical sign of manuscripts. Monks used to mark the page with special tools, they used the resulting lines as a way to write straight. I made them with the opacity of a black ink set to 0.2</p>

      <h3>Images</h3>
      <p>I did not apply any filter to images because it would be non "historically correct". Obviously photos did not exist during late medieval age, but at the same time there are plenty of manuscripts with rich colors and miniatures. Started from this assumption I think that if photography had existed during that age miniatures would have used them with the higher color available.</p>

      		<h3>Time Period</h3>
      		<p>1920</p>
      		<h3>Concept</h3>
      		<p>The 1920 typographical style is intended to reproduce the atmosphere of the <b>Roaring Twenties</b> and their luxorious attitude to decoration.</p>
      		<p>The term "Art Deco" is taken from the name of the 1925 Paris exhibition titled <em>Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes</em>. The most popular and respected French artists and craftsmen of the day showcased their works.	Art Deco could be addressed as a modern and dynamic interpretation of the precedent movement: Art Nouveau. Starting from the natular shapes and floral details, Art Deco embraces sinous curves and horror vacui tendencies combining them with a modern interpretation. The Machine Age transformed the rounded naturalistic motifs of Nouveau with geometric, angular and streamlined motifs, like zigzags and chevrons. Embracing the future in all its glamourousness was the focus of Art Deco.</p>
      		<br>
      		<h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
      			<ul>
      				<li><b>Geometry</b><br>
      				One of Art Deco's main characteristics derive from repetitive use of linear and geometric shapes including triangular, zigzagged, trapeziodal  and chevron-patterned forms. This attitude is embodied in the geometrical pattern used as <code>background-image</code>. The decorative nature of those years is expressed also in the <code>q</code> and <code>figcaption</code> elements, framed by a geometrical and stilish borders.</li>
      				<li><b>Metals</b><br>
      				A fondative feature of the Deco style is the celebration of metals. The employment of new materials in the creation of mordern machines emphasized the enthusiasm for modernity and luxury. The <b>Roaring Style</b> is intended to reproduce the elegant modernity of the 20's also in colors: all the texts have a metal effect due to a background golden image, used also for decorative frames.</li>
      				<li><b>Fonts</b><br>
      				The highly decorative soul of Art Deco is expressed also in the development of new typographic fonts which influenced advertisement for many decades. Combining the essential and decorative attitude in a functional design, the Deco fonts range from being ornamental to essential and rectilinear. Thus, the choosen fonts are monostroke for <code>h2</code> and <code>body</code> and more decorative and elegant for <code>h1</code> and <code>h3</code>.

      		<h3>Time Period</h3>
      		<p>1980</p>
      		<h3>Concept</h3>
      		<p>The 1980 typographical style is intended to reproduce the <b>Neon Noir</b> atmosphere typical of the 80's blockbusters and videogames.</p>
      		<p><em>Neon Noir</em> refers to the genre focusing on dark crime-police stories, like Risky Business and Thief. This Neon-Noir influence influenced the graphic design of several TV Shows and movies, reguardless of the actual contents. TV and Movie posters are the basis of this 80's typographical style.</p>
      		<br>
      		<h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
      			<ul>
      				<li><b>Neon</b><br>
      				The most outstanding feature of this style is the employment of neon colors. The dark glitchy background recall the television medium and enanches the vivid colors of texts.
      				Brightness in opposition of dark backgrounds, with its disco taste, is one of the main features of 80's style.</li>
      				<li><b>Fonts</b><br>
      				A fondative feature of the 80's style is the use of several and different typefaces. The 80's style is characterized by a huge variety of different , pairing monolitic and futuristic shapes with brushed scripts, compact sans-serifs with light handwritten lettering with exaggerated lenghts. According to this variety, the choices for the 80's design embraced dynamic font pairings. Four different typefces were used in the style, embracing the 80's vibes.</li>
      				<li><b>Play with colors</b><br>
      				The 80's style was heavily influenced by the advancement of technology. This futuristic issue commonly used neon aestetich, gradients and mirrored sheen effect. The result is an almost overdone style, with plenty of layering and over the top text effects. Neon, multiple and vibrant colors, glow spots. With the <code>linear-gradient</code> property, the css sets the colorful backgrounds of <code>h2</code> and a faded <code>text-shadow</code> makes the frist heading neonish.

      <h2>Context</h2> 
      <p>Web Technologies exam, DHDK master degree, Bologna University, academic year: 2018-2019</p>
      <h2>Description</h2> 
      <h3>Time Period</h3>
      <p>2050</p>
      <h3>Concept</h3>
      <p>The 2050 typographical style aims to reproduce the future (or past) way of making typographical layout.</p>
      <h3>Fictionalised concept</h3>
      <p>The result of the 2060-2061 class of DHDK web technologies course. This style want to reproduce the common way of make typography at the beginning of last decade.</p>
      <h4>History</h4>
      <p>Description (fictional description): the development of cloud technologies reached a new level. Through the use of contact lenses we are now connected to the net itself. After the initial hype there was a fisiological drop in interest in this technology. During the <em>new information conference</em> held Rome in 2031, the use of smart contact lenses started to become much more common among people. 1 year later there was another huge progression, the use of a background theme. This improvement started by the will of some people to feel immersed in a virtual space.
      The development stopped between 2037 and 2045 due to the III world war between the Neo-URSS and the Great Capitalist America.
      After a tremendous war the Neo-URSS resulted victorius and smart contact lenses restarted to improve.
      During last years of '40s there was a huge revival of old fashioned way to think the net and in 2049 It is possible to say that the technology reached the complete development.</p>
      <h3>Layout</h3>
      <p>The use of smart contact lenses allow the display of paragraphs in the whole human visual area. Headers follow the human eye all along the area. However the poor state of technologies during the '10s and '20s does not allow the complete visualisation. That type of devices only allow the display of paragraphs divided in 2 series: odd ones are alligned on the left, even ones on the right. Additionally Tables, quotes, lists, figures show a third display that expand from the center. The initial animation show the progressive display of each element starting from an opacity of 0 and a complete padding.
      I chose the background thinking to the fictional story: after a first moment of having real world reproduction as background, at the end of '40s there was a huge revival of the old way of thinking internet: a network of electrical connections. The image is repeated along the y-axis in order to cover the complete article.</p>
      <p>Every elements have a light blue border and a light background color that become more opaque when hovering.</p>
      <h3>Font</h3>
      <p>According to the fictional story, I chose a font that reflect the actual way of thinking the future fonts: Zero Hour font is used for headers while I used the Neuropol one for the remaining text. I left the standard weight and letterspacing of CSS without any further work on them.</p>
      <p>As in the humanistic one, the font size is modeled according to advices of a specific website. The source sections provides the original website.</p>

      <h3>Animation</h3>
      <p>There are 4 animations: one for odd paragraphs, one for even ones and one for tables, figures, quotes and lists. The beginning opacity is set to 0 with a linear transition to 1. Additionally paragraphs start from a 50% left and 50% padding and linearly dispay themselves until the result is reached.
      There is a little delay of 2 seconds allowing the complete loading of pages on the homepage's iframe.
      The <em>"animation-fill-mode: forwards;"</em> property maintain the final state of the animation.</p>
      <h3>Fictional error message</h3>
      <p>According to the fictional story I created also an error message: its aim is to add a little detail to the story. A little addition to Javascript fire an Alert to advice the user of using smart contact lenses to enjoy the full style. Obviously since we are at the beginning of '20s it is impossible to follow the advice.</p>

      		<p>We created 2 different scripts for 2 different reasons.
      		The first script is the one that change the content and the style of the iframe. a little Javascript is used firstly to change the SRC of the iframe and then through the <em>onload</em> wait until the page is loaded and then the CSS is changed. Javascript go inside the iframe document and change the link element marked with a special ID. During the charge the iframe is set to <em>display: none;</em> and JS makes visible another div that normally has no display. This div has a background loading gif that we use during the iframe loading.
          Cross origin domain problems are avoided thanks to the fact that all pages share the same domain so the browser does not stop these operation although generally forbidden.
          </p>

      		<p>The second script is used to automatically populate the page of the EU-directive. In fact at the beginning the page is empty and only through 2 fetch methods the page is populated with all tags coming from 2 different HTML documents. We realized this script in order to have something that automatically take elements of different language versions of the same document and puts them in a grid without a long manual encoding. To work properly the user must have clear what he want. Indeed the script go inside the <em>article</em> element and take all its children, put them in an HTML collection and then it can start to iterate and place all elements in the page. According to our preferences we created an raw html without any other intermediate div or sections in order to take basic elements. It is possible to change the structure according to our preferences.</p>
          <p>All elements are put in a grid with an equal point of start for each couple of elements. The language difference still allows having different end points.</p>
